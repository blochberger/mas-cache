# mas-cache

This utility allows you to scan the cache files of the Mac App Store (MAS) for applications. This is useful for doing research on macOS applications, e. g., if you want to analyse the top free apps.

The goal is somewhat similar to what [mas-crawl](https://github.com/0xbf00/mas-crawl) achieves by crawling MAS preview pages. Unfortunately, that approach currently does not work.

## Installation

```sh
python -m venv .env
. .env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --editable .

# Configure
cp settings.example.json core/settings.json
vim core/settings.json
# Note that SECRET_KEY can be generated with:
#    from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
#    get_random_secret_key()

manage migrate
```

## Usage

In order to populate the cache, open the App Store application and browse a bit. Then simply run:

```sh
manage scan
```

Since the cache is cleared quite aggressively, you should run the command often, e. g., after you open a page in the MAS (and fully scrolled down).

Once you scanned the applications, you can print the list of top free apps:

```sh
manage charts --skip-bundles --skip-unknown
```

The output will look something like:

```
Store: de

[â€¦]
```

If you want to install the applications, I recommend to take a look at [maap](https://github.com/0xbf00/maap). You can export the application IDs as list, which can then be used with `appstaller`:

```sh
manage charts --skip-bundles --list
```

You can also export the list as JSON:

```sh
manage charts --skip-bundles --json
```

To get the latest metadata (JSON) for an application, you can run the following command:

```sh
manage metadata 409201541
```

Alternatively, you can query the [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/), although the formats are different:

```sh
curl 'https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=409201541'
```

If you want to lookup many application, I recommend to use [mas-crawl](https://github.com/0xbf00/mas-crawl).
